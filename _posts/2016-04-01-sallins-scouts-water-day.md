SALLINS SCOUT GROUP - BIG WATER DAY - 2ND APRIL 2016

Everything but the weather is arranged for next Saturday 

The Scouts will be canoeing from 12.45 -- 14.45 and there will be a charge of €12\*, bring this on the day.

\*These charges are subsidised by the group.

We will be building a monkey bridge at 10.30 across the canal which the public can attempt later in the day, so we'll need all hands on deck to make that a success -- it's a big project. Meeting outside The Grange Café. 

There will be pop up tents to change into their wetsuits. Wetsuits will be provided but if anybody has their own wetsuit and buoyancy aids they should bring them, it's bound to be more comfortable.

All participants will need a towel, tee shirt, shorts/togs and a wool cap. 

Your scout should also bring a packed lunch and plenty of drinks.

We also hope to have a cake/bake sale, so we would appreciate you sending down any tasty baked goods you can muster on the day.
